This is a port of the popular tile game by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://www.gabrielecirulli.com/) written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). This repo is a medium for me to experiment with Elixir, [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [OTP](http://erlang.org/doc/system_architecture_intro/sys_arch_intro.html), to demonstrate my knowledge, and so my fianc√© can play her favorite game without ads.

The game uses LiveView, which obviously isn't ideal for this type of game, but, again, this is a sandbox for my personal learning and enjoyment. That said, if you have a decent internet connection, you likely won't notice any serious latency.
