        <h1>2048</h1>
        <p>This is a port of the popular tile game by <a href="https://www.gabrielecirulli.com/">Gabriele Cirulli</a> written in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. This repo is a medium for me to experiment with the Elixir language, <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/system_architecture_intro/sys_arch_intro.html">OTP</a>, to show off what I know, and so that my fianc√© can play her favorite game without all of the annoying ads. üòù</p>
        <p>The game uses LiveView, which obviously isn't ideal for this type of game, but, again, this is a sandbox for my personal learning and enjoyment. That said, if you have a decent internet connection, you likely won't notice any serious latency.</p>
